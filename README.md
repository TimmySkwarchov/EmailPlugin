# EmailPlugin
 Email plugin for UE4.27. Thanks to CSMTP and OpenSSL
 # Before starting
 I cannot compile this plugin because Visual Studio is now broken, and I cannot do anything. So, If you want, you can create fork, then download entire repo, then code until no errors appearing. Is succeed, DM me in Discord (your local trolling guy#0950) link to binaries ONLY ON GOOGLE DRIVE, so I can add as release and recode in main branch
 # SMTP servers and its ports

If you need more SMTP servers like Yandex, please let me know them
